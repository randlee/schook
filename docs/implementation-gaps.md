# Implementation Gaps

This gap ledger remains the current implementation-gap reference for release
honesty, removals, and deferred work. Current control-doc ownership lives in:

- [docs/requirements.md](requirements.md)
- [docs/architecture.md](architecture.md)
- [docs/project-plan.md](project-plan.md)
- [docs/traceability.md](traceability.md)

## Closed Items

### DEF-009: Observability Failure Fallback Integration Test

- Status: `closed in SC-LOG-S6`
- Owner area:
  - `sc-hooks-cli`, docs
- Closure note:
  - integration coverage now forces logger-init, emit, append, and prune
    degradation paths through the real `sc-hooks-cli` runtime
  - the closing tests are:
    - `standard_mode_logger_init_failure_is_non_blocking`
    - `standard_mode_emit_failure_is_non_blocking`
    - `full_mode_append_failure_is_non_blocking`
    - `full_mode_prune_failure_is_non_blocking`
  - those tests prove the degraded stderr fallback remains visible while hook
    exits do not change

### DEF-015: Non-Blocking Observability And Audit Failures

- Status: `closed in SC-LOG-S6`
- Owner area:
  - `sc-hooks-cli`, docs
- Closure note:
  - the same four integration tests above now prove logger-init, emit, append,
    and prune failures are all best-effort and never change hook execution
    outcomes
